How to pass data in component? with props.
In React JSX everything is props including JXS HTML markup-tags-attributes, JS variable, CSS and Components. React component talk each other by props.
Props are not static, it is change over the time. But props are immutable, you can't mutate the props. Suppose there have a props name person={nema:"", age:""}, you shoudn't change the person props by human={name:person.name,age:person.age}. React change the props reference immutable in memmory management and create a different reference for new props.
