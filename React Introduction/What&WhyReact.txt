ReactJS is combined with React and ReactDOM.

*React: is a JS library that helped us to make User Interface with JS. React handle everything via JSX, actually we write JS in JSX.
React structured UI and manage state and it's interact behaviour. React creates needed HTML tags/element of JSX. React work in Virtual DOM. React provides hooks, method, state and works with application state and logic. React control application side effects, components initialization and updates of a Application. React works like a chefs or cooker.

*ReactDOM: is work like a waiter, and work with given data of React. ReactDOM creates the actual DOM in browsers. It decides what will render in browser and which structure will unmounting. ReactDOM taking the top root element and injects the needed JSX/HTML property into root element and unnescessery JSX will removed/unmount by ReactDOM. Event handler is handled/mantain by the ReactDOM before gone to the bussiness logic(React manage the bussiness logic and state)
